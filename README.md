# To-Do-List

This is my first github project and it has been 2 weeks since I started learning Javascript. 
As you can see from the code, I am familiar with a bit of html and css.

To-Do-List details:
It is a fairly simple to-do-list web application 

Here is the website link for the application: https://retarddev.github.io/To-Do-List/

I hope this project can help others that are also starting out and if you have any questions please do not hesistate to contact me.
